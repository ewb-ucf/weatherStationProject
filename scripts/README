Version: n0.1.0a

File Structure:

    lib/
    Contains libraries and classes used in the run files

    old/
    Contains files that should be deleted before production but maybe useful in
    the near future

    miniruns/
    Contains the individual run files for each of the sensors. 
    The individual run files run as background scripts and collect data
    at the period and frequency specified in the "lib/settings.py" file

    run.py
    This script is the control script that is executed when the RPi boots. It
    initializes all the sensors that are connected and in the settings file and
    runs tests to verify them. Then it starts all the individual processes for
    each sensor program (Eg. run_SENSORNAME_sensor.py)
